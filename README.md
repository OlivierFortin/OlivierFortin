# 👋 Hello, I'm Olivier

I'm a passionate educator and developer, currently teaching at the Cégep de St-Jean. I specialize in low-level development and am a staunch advocate for Open Source. 

## 🎓 Teaching

Imparting knowledge is one of my greatest passions. I believe in the power of education and strive to bring out the best in my students at Cégep de St-Jean, where I guide them through the intricate world of low-level development and security.

## 🎯 Coding

When it comes to development, my primary tool of choice is Neovim. A highly configurable and extendable IDE, Neovim allows me to streamline my workflow and efficiently tackle complex problems. My language of choice? Low-level languages, where I relish the challenge and precision they offer.

## 🏁 Capture The Flag (CTF)

Besides teaching, I enjoy delving into the thrilling world of CTF challenges. It allows me to sharpen my problem-solving skills and keep up to date with the latest in cybersecurity. I also stream these sessions on Twitch, making it an interactive and fun learning experience for my students and followers alike.

## 💻 Operating System

Linux. It's more than just an OS for me; it's a way of life. I appreciate its philosophy, its community, and above all, the control it provides to its users. As an open-source advocate, I find that Linux embodies the principles I hold dear.
